# Changelog — `AgentHostProtocol` Swift Package

All notable changes to the Swift package (`AgentHostProtocol` +
`AgentHostProtocolClient` products) are documented here. See
[`../../CHANGELOG.md`](../../CHANGELOG.md) for the protocol spec changelog
and [`release-metadata.json`](release-metadata.json) for the machine-readable
mapping between the current source tree and protocol versions.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)
and the package follows [SemVer](https://semver.org).

SwiftPM resolves packages by matching plain `vX.Y.Z` git tags at the repo
root, so Swift releases use the bare semver tag namespace (no `swift/`
prefix). The `publish-swift.yml` workflow refuses to publish a `vX.Y.Z` tag
whose matching `## [X.Y.Z]` heading is missing from this file, and verifies
the tag matches the version pinned in [`VERSION`](VERSION).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `status` and `error` fields on `ChangesetOperation` and the
  `changeset/operationStatusChanged` action, tracking the
  `idle → running → error` lifecycle of a changeset operation.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-28

Implements AHP `0.2.0`.

First versioned Swift Package Manager release. Includes:

- `AgentHostProtocol` product — generated wire types, actions, commands,
  notifications, errors, reducers (`AHPRootReducer`, `AHPSessionReducer`,
  `AHPTerminalReducer`, `AHPChangesetReducer`, `NativeReducer`). Includes
  the extended `resource*` family (`resourceResolve`, `resourceMkdir`,
  `createResourceWatch`, the new `ahp-resource-watch:/` channel with the
  `resourceWatch/changed` action), `ResourceWriteParams`'s `mode` /
  `position` / `ifMatch` fields, the new `Conflict` (`-32011`) error code,
  and the bidirectional content-bearing `resource*` surface exposed on
  both `CommandMap` and `ServerCommandMap`.
- `UserMessage.meta` optional `[String: AnyCodable]?` field (serialized as
  `_meta`), exposing the new spec-level provider metadata channel on user
  messages. The generated `init` gains a trailing `meta:` parameter that
  defaults to `nil`.
- `AgentHostProtocolClient` product — single-host `AHPClient`, multi-host
  `MultiHostClient`, `AHPStateMirror` / `MultiHostStateMirror`, transports
  (`URLSessionWebSocketTransport`, `NWConnectionWebSocketTransport`,
  `InMemoryTransport`), and persistent client-ID stores.
- Generated `PROTOCOL_VERSION` and `SUPPORTED_PROTOCOL_VERSIONS` constants
  on the `AgentHostProtocol` module.
