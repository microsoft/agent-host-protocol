# Root Channel

The root channel is the top-level channel every AHP server exposes. It carries global state — the agents the server provides, the terminals it manages, and host-level configuration — plus the catalogue events for sessions.

## URI

```
ahp-root://
```

Exactly one root channel exists per server. Clients SHOULD subscribe to it during the handshake via `initialSubscriptions` to receive the agent list, terminal list, and host config in the same round-trip.

## State

Subscribers receive a [`RootState`](/reference/root#rootstate) snapshot:

```typescript
RootState {
  agents: AgentInfo[]
  activeSessions?: number
  terminals?: TerminalInfo[]
  config?: RootConfigState
}
```

- `agents` — agent backends the server can speak to, including any `protectedResources` they require for authentication. See [Authentication](/specification/authentication).
- `activeSessions` — count of non-disposed sessions. Lightweight badge counter.
- `terminals` — lightweight per-terminal metadata for rendering a terminal manager UI without subscribing to every terminal. See [Terminal Channel](/specification/terminal-channel) for the full state.
- `config` — host-level configuration schema and current values.

The session list is **not** part of root state. Clients fetch it imperatively via [`listSessions`](/reference/root#listsessions) and patch it from `root/*` notifications described below.

## Methods and events on this channel

This section lists wire methods that are interpreted in the context of
`ahp-root://`. If `params.channel` is some other URI, they are handled by the
target channel instead.

### Commands (`params.channel = "ahp-root://"`)

| Method | Kind | Why it belongs on root |
|---|---|---|
| `initialize` | request | Connection-level handshake command; scoped to the root channel. |
| `ping` | request | Connection liveness check; scoped to the root channel. |
| `reconnect` | request | Connection resume/replay negotiation; scoped to the root channel. |
| `listSessions` | request | Session catalogue lives on root (`root/session*` events keep the cache fresh). |
| `resourceRead` | request | Filesystem/content access is connection-level, not session-local. |
| `resourceWrite` | request | Filesystem/content access is connection-level, not session-local. |
| `resourceList` | request | Filesystem/content access is connection-level, not session-local. |
| `resourceCopy` | request | Filesystem/content access is connection-level, not session-local. |
| `resourceDelete` | request | Filesystem/content access is connection-level, not session-local. |
| `resourceMove` | request | Filesystem/content access is connection-level, not session-local. |
| `resourceRequest` | request | Permission grant/revocation flow is connection-level. |
| `authenticate` | request | Bearer-token push for protected resources is connection-level. |
| `resolveSessionConfig` | request | Pre-creation config resolution happens before any session channel exists. |
| `sessionConfigCompletions` | request | Completes dynamic fields in pre-creation session config. |

### Notifications (`params.channel = "ahp-root://"`)

| Method | Kind | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `action` | server → client notification | Root-scoped action envelope (`root/*` action payloads). |
| `root/sessionAdded` | server → client notification | Session catalogue entry created. |
| `root/sessionRemoved` | server → client notification | Session catalogue entry removed. |
| `root/sessionSummaryChanged` | server → client notification | Session catalogue entry mutated. |
| `unsubscribe` | client → server notification | Stop receiving root-channel messages. |
| `dispatchAction` | client → server notification | Dispatch a root-scoped client action (currently `root/configChanged`). |

`auth/required` may also be emitted on `ahp-root://` when the auth requirement
is root-scoped; see [Authentication](/specification/authentication).

## Actions

Root state is mutated by action envelopes broadcast on this channel. Refer to the [Root Channel Reference](/reference/root#actions) for the full list; the root-scoped actions are:

| Action | Direction | Reducer effect |
|---|---|---|
| `root/agentsChanged` | Server | Replaces `agents` |
| `root/activeSessionsChanged` | Server | Replaces `activeSessions` |
| `root/terminalsChanged` | Server | Replaces `terminals` |
| `root/configChanged` | Server / Client | Merges (or replaces) `config.values` |

All root-scoped action envelopes have `channel: "ahp-root://"`.

## Protocol Notifications

In addition to action envelopes, the server pushes per-session catalogue events to subscribers of `ahp-root://`. These notifications keep cached session lists in sync without subscribing to every session URI individually.

### `root/sessionAdded`

Emitted when a new session is created.

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "root/sessionAdded",
  "params": {
    "channel": "ahp-root://",
    "summary": { "resource": "ahp-session:/<uuid>", "title": "New Session", "status": 1, "createdAt": 1710000000000, "modifiedAt": 1710000000000 }
  }
}
```

### `root/sessionRemoved`

Emitted when a session is disposed.

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "root/sessionRemoved",
  "params": {
    "channel": "ahp-root://",
    "session": "ahp-session:/<uuid>"
  }
}
```

### `root/sessionSummaryChanged`

Emitted when any mutable field on an existing [`SessionSummary`](/reference/session#sessionsummary) changes (title, status, `modifiedAt`, model, working directory, read/done state, diff statistics, …). Only the changed fields are carried; identity fields (`resource`, `provider`, `createdAt`) never change and MUST be omitted.

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "root/sessionSummaryChanged",
  "params": {
    "channel": "ahp-root://",
    "session": "ahp-session:/<uuid>",
    "changes": {
      "title": "Refactor auth middleware",
      "status": 8,
      "modifiedAt": 1710000123456
    }
  }
}
```

Servers MAY coalesce or debounce this notification for noisy fields — for example, rapid `modifiedAt` bumps during a streaming turn, or frequent `diffs` updates during an edit burst. Clients that have no cached entry for `session` MAY ignore the notification.

Like all protocol notifications, the `root/*` events are ephemeral and are **not** replayed on reconnect. After reconnecting, clients SHOULD re-fetch the catalogue via [`listSessions`](/reference/root#listsessions).

## Authentication Events

The server MAY emit [`auth/required`](/specification/authentication#auth-expiry-notification) on the root channel when an agent's protected resource needs (re-)authentication. See [Authentication](/specification/authentication) for the full flow.
